    <p>The eastern oyster, 
Crassostrea virginica, is a 
native species of oyster 
common to the eastern 
seaboard and coveted by 
naturalists and seafood 
enthusiasts alike for its unique 
life cycle and salty taste. 
Oyster beds are a vital part of 
Florida’s thriving estuaries. 
Oysters are a vital part of a 
thriving marine ecosystem. 
      Oysters are a Florida <b>keystone species</b>, a species on which other species in an ecosystem largely depend, such that if 
they were removed the ecosystem would change drastically. Oyster beds provide   habitat, food, and protection for a numerous species of animals that live in and around them. As filter feeders, oysters help to remove particulate matter from the surrounding water and help to improve overall water quality. A single oyster can filter anywhere from 20 to 50 gallons of water a day! Oysters are also known as <b>ecosystem engineers</b> because they have the ability to create orsignificantly modify the surrounding habitat and they are an important part of maintain a healthy and stable environment. They 
      help to dissipate wave energy, which in turn reduces erosion along the shoreline.</p>
<p>
Oysters start out as free floating larvae called spat. These spat float around in the water column looking for somewhere to land using a rudimentary eyespot. If they oyster spat does not find a hard surface to settle on, it perishes. Once the 
oyster larva settles onto a hard substrate it begins to grow, and once it reaches the size of your pinky finger 
nail it is finally considered to be an oyster. Multiple spat can land on one oyster shell and grow to maturity, this helps to create the reef structure over ti
me. Oysters have the ability to land on anything hard; dock pilings, concrete sea walls, tree trucks...but they 
prefer to land on other oysters as it is a good indicator that there is enough food and protection to create a bed.</p>
<p>However, oyster populations in Florida are quickly declining due to over harvesting, brown tide events, rising sea levels, and careless boaters. Globally over 85% of shellfish reefs are gone, and locally our oyster reefs are declining rapidly. By recycling oyster shell from local restaurants we can help to create new oys
ter reefs to insure their success for years to come.</p>
